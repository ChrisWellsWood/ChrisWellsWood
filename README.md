### Hello!

I'm Chris Wood, I'm a lecturer in biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh. My group
develops and applies tools for engineering and designing proteins. We use a range of
techniques to do this including machine learning, geometric modelling and molecular
simulation. We're interested in creating new proteins that address some of the
challenges that we face as a society, and making tools that are accessible, so that
other researchers that are non specialists can do the same.

Check out [our group website](www.wellswoodresearchgroup.com) for more information.
